.TH LFS-MIGRATE 1 2015-12-07 "Lustre" "Lustre Utilities"
.SH NAME
lfs migrate \- migrate files or directories between MDTs or OSTs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs migrate
\fI-m mdt_idx\fR [-v|--verbose] \fI<directory>\fR
.br
.B lfs migrate
.RI [OPTIONS] ... <file|directory>\fR...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Migrate MDT inodes or OST objects between MDTs and OSTs respectively. For the
case of MDT inode migration:
.TP
.B migrate -m|--mdt-index <mdt_idx> \fIdirectory\fR
.br
Move the file metadata (inode) from one MDT to MDT with index \fBmdt_idx\fR.
Migration of striped directories or individual files between MDTs is not
currently supported. Only the root user can migrate directories.  Files that
have been archived by HSM or are currently open are skipped by MDT inode
migration. Access to files within the directory is blocked until migration is
complete.
.TP
\fIWARNING\fR
A migrated file or directory will have a new inode number and FID.  As
a consequence, files archieved by Lustre HSM cannot currently be migrated
and migrated files that have a new inode number may confuse backup tools.
.TP
For the case of OST object migration:
.TP
.B migrate
.B [--stripe-count|-c \fIstripe_count\fR]
.B [--stripe-index|-i \fIstart_ost_idx\fR]
.B [--stripe-size|-S \fIstripe_size\fR]
.B [--pool|-p \fIpool_name\fR]
.B [--ost-list|-o \fIost_indices\fR]
.B [--block|-b]
.B [--non-block|-n] \fIfile|directory\fR
.br
Migrate can also be used for OST objects by omitting \fI-m\fR option. In this
mode, the command has identical options to
.BR lfs-setstripe (1).
The difference between migrate and setstripe is that \fImigrate\fR will
re-layout the data in existing files using the new layout parameter by copying
the data from the existing OST(s) to the new OST(s). In contrast,
\fIsetstripe\fR is used for creating new files with the specified layout.  For
more information, see setstripe in lfs(1).
.P
NOTE: lfs migrate has a complementary script
.B lfs_migrate
which is used to provide extra functionality when migrating file data
between OSTs and has a separate man page.
.SH EXAMPLES
Move the inodes contained in ./testremote from their current MDT to the
MDT with index 0:
.HP
.B $ lfs migrate -m 0 ./testremote
.SH AUTHOR
