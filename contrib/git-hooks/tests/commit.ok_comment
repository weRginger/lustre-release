LU-3568 contrib: ignore initial comments

Sometimes, git likes to insert "git status" commentary
at the top of an auto-generated commit message starter
file. If the committer carelessly neglects to remove
the stuff, the script thinks the message has a missing
commit summary line.

* contrib/tests/test-commit-msg.sh: pass through xtrace setting
* contrib/tests/commit.ok_commit: This message with cruft
* contrib/commit-msg: use a flag instead of a line number to see
  if we still need to process the summary line.
