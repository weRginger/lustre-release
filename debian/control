Description: Linux kernel patch for the Lustre Filesystem
 Lustre is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available
 cluster file system. This release is maintained by Intel Corporation
 and available from https://wiki.hpdd.intel.com/
 .
 Lustre servers require a number of patches to the core Linux kernel,
 mostly to export new functions, add features to ext3, and add
 a new locking path to the VFS. This package provides these patches
 for kernel versions 2.6.18, 2.6.21 and 2.6.22 on i386, amd64, powerpc
 and ia64 architectures.
 .
 For Lustre clients, you will also need to build a lustre-modules
 package, using the lustre-source package and module-assistant.
